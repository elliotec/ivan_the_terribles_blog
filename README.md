# My New Blog!

Normally, I'd paginate to make UX better, but the scoring is based on resources on the front page so I will leave them and just cache it all. 
[Here's the current test](https://loadimpact.com/test/view/1598636), kinda poor right now but hopefully will improve with clarification tomorrow.


I've got a lot to say, and now I have a place to say it!!!!!

Read all my amazing posts!!!!! You can load them into the app with: `rake load:blog`

Since I know you want to read them all, I designed my page to show EVERYTHING on the front page of the site!!!!!
